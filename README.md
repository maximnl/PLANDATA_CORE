A corporate report can be made in a variety of ways and variety of systems will support your. A general report requires carefull data selection, filtering, some extra calculations. Reports are percieved as a single version of truth. However , few people realise that information in the report is available via this report only. As reports mix data with formating and layout this poresents a fundamental problem for scalability, integrity , analysis and forecasting as we cannot simply pull data from a report. For management information 2 needs we need an extra analytical layer between reporting wordld and data world to keep things in sync. PLANDATA_CORE is a reporting and forecasting data framework for God sync purposes. I hope it will become a game changer and majority of corporate report will be made via this magic sync layer. 

PLANDATA_CORE can be used for Management information applications such as force management (WFM), project management, corporate reporting. The framework allows to overcome additional and less  fundametal limitations of reports-datawarehouses tandem such as - long execution jobs, slow development time, high costs, lack of release management, hidden metadata (in reports, lists etc), one way road, data scope limitations, plan metadata spread and more. I will publish an article soon on LinkedIn about present Management Information shortcummings. 

In teh nutshell the framework allows 3 things:
1. Automate pulling of data from any database source, text file source or datawarehouse. 
2. Convert data into extended time series data and do all kinds of operations on time series data, combine them, subtract, convert, forecast
3. Control 1-2 from an easy to use application such that most of ICT tasks can be done by a business person. A your company and your approach grow, easiness to change things becomes very important to catch up with the business and grow the business.

So this is work in progress, as I have to pull different parts from various production systems, but hier is a first batch, some basic dimensions  that we will need very soon, 

if you like the ideas please feel free to catch up. I live in Arnhem, The Netherlands. Check my LinkedIn, lets get connected and help each other. The World is big!

With kind regards
